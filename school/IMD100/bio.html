				<p>Jackson Pollock: American painter. He was an 
				important practitioner of Abstract Expressionism. He 
				was born in Cody, Wyoming, into a poor sheep farming
				family and was originally interested in sculpture, 
				but joined the Art Students' League of New York in 
				1929 and was taught painting by Thomas Hart Benton. 
				He developed a romantic Regionalist style influenced
				by Ryder during the 1930s. As a member of the Federal
				Art project 1938-42, he met a number of avant garde 
				artists (he exhibited with de Kooning in 1940) and 
				discovered Picasso's work and Surrealism (he was part
				of the New York Surrealist exhibition in 1942 and 
				wrote automatic poetry). In 1939, he underwent 
				psychiatric counselling and came into contact with 
				the ideas of Jung. He began a series of semi 
				figurative pieces, using symbolism from Native 
				American culture (Navajo sand painting) and primitive
				art, influenced by the Mexican Rivera and 
				incorporating a heavily applied technique which 
				suggested violent spontaneity (e.g. She-Wolf 1943, 
				New York).</p>
				
				<p>Pollock was already experimenting with Surrealist
				automatism, but after the War he settled in Long 
				Island and began to develop the Action techniques for
				which he is best known, dripping and throwing paint 
				onto large canvases which were laid on the studio 
				floor and only cut once the work was completed. He 
				produced his first such abstraction in 1945. The 
				intention was to avoid a focus for the work, to be 
				part of it during creation (actually walking over 
				it), to treat it as an object and to work semi 
				automatically ('painting has a life of its own'). 
				His attitude was later influential to Performance 
				artists and happenings.</p>
				
				<p>Despite his abstraction, Pollock used evocative, 
				descriptive titles for many of these works (e.g. 
				Cathedral, 1947, Dallas). The mesh of drips and 
				dashes, often textured by the addition of sand and 
				other materials, created a floating spatial rhythm. 
				In 1951, suffering from alcoholic depression, he 
				reduced his colours and began to work with black 
				enamels of unprimed canvas. Dreamlike figures began 
				to creep back into his work (e.g. Portrait and Dream,
				1953, private collection). Pollock died in a car 
				crash in 1956.</p>
